      Hey! If you're reading this -- I appreciate you for reading this! I am pumped to get the ball rolling with DBC. I've researched and researched...and then I researched some more til I landed here. I feel this will be a journey to another land. I have been on so many journeys in my life that I don't find myself intimidated in trying something new, or I've learned to zone that fear out. DBC incorporates the social aspect of everything we do in our daily lives and tied it to "programming"(which we haven't even started yet!)

      DBC is NOTHING like I expected from what I was reading and researching online. In fact it has been better than I could imagine, and I don't know a damn thing! There is an awesome support team, they have created a cohort support environment to help boost each other up, and all the staff has been very supportive thus far!

      In all the experiences in my life, I've done the best when there is the proverbial fire lit under my ass. Fourth quarter, two minute warning, shot clocks running down with 5 seconds left, and they are towing your car away in the parking lot. As crazy as it sounds I hope this will be difficult, in the sense of learning programming and human relations.

      In the words of Batman: "The body makes the jump."
